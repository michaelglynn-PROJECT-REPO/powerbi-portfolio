# PowerBI Portfolio
A curated portfolio of Power BI projects showcasing advanced data visualization, report optimization, and custom DAX logic. Projects include a native Power BI replacement of Zebra BI visuals for financial reporting and a visually rich education dashboard. Designed for job applications and internal career progression.

I'm a Data Analyst working in education and finance. I specialize in Power BI visual storytelling, smart DAX logic, and performance-tuned reporting. This portfolio highlights key projects I’ve developed, showcasing a broad range of analytical and design skills.
I’m currently completing a Data Analyst apprenticeship with Cambridge Spark, expected to finish in February 2026.
