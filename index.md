## About

This curated portfolio showcases Power BI projects I've built across various sectors, highlighting advanced data visualization, custom DAX logic, and performance-tuned reporting.  
Projects include:
- Migrating Zebra BI visuals to native Power BI for financial reporting
- Designing rich educational dashboards for college-wide insight
- Creating smart matrix tables, waterfall visuals, and dynamic drillthrough logic

I'm currently completing a Data Analyst apprenticeship with **Cambridge Spark**, expected to finish in February 2026.
