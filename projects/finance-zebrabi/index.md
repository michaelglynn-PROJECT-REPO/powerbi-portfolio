## Project Goal:
Replace ZebraBI visuals with native Power BI visuals to reduce cost and improve maintainability.

---

## Key Features:
Matrix & Waterfall visual mimicking ZebraBI

Smart DAX measures for YTD/ITM and drillthrough

Dynamic row-level control and tooltips

---

## Tools & Techniques
Power BI Desktop, DAX

LabelDimMap design for display logic

Performance optimization (matrix loading down from 82s → 8s)

---

## Visuals
[View Before (Zebra BI)](./visuals/Finance%20Reports%20for%20SM%20&%20AM%20(Before)%20REDACTED.pdf)

[View After (Native Power BI)](./visuals/Finance%20Reports%20for%20SM%20&%20AM%20(After)%20REDACTED.pdf)

Highlights: Smart Matrix, Conditional Formatting, Custom Drillthrough

## Commentary
This project really pushed my understanding of DAX scoping and visual design. I learned how to reconstruct ZebraBI visuals using native features without losing functionality.
